# Hi, I'm Emma Garrison 👋

I'm a physicist focused on computational modeling and network analysis,
with applications in neuroscience and complex systems.

## Research Interests
- Graph theory and network measures
- Time series analysis
- MRI preprocessing and analysis pipelines
- Statistical modeling of high-dimensional data

## Tools
- MATLAB
- Python
- R

## Selected Projects
- **fMRI Preprocessing** – Preprocessing of fMRI data for the creation of functional brain networks
- **DTI Preprocessing** - Preprocessing of DTI data for the creation of stuctural brain networks
- **Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models Hypothesis-Building Procedure** – Novel procedure for determining from the data the relevant factors in a SAOM. 

## Notes
This GitHub serves as a research portfolio and personal reference.
Code is written for clarity and reproducibility rather than production use.
